## Getting Started

**_Check out our Cloud offering at [Promptly](https://trypromptly.com) or follow the instructions below to deploy LLMStack on your own infrastructure._**

LLMStack deployment comes with a default admin account whose credentials are `admin` and `promptly`. _Be sure to change the password from admin panel after logging in_.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

LLMStack depends on a background docker container to run jobs. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine if want to use jobs. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

#### Install LLMStack using `pip`

```sh
pip install llmstack
```

> If you are on windows, please use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to install LLMStack. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to install WSL2. Once you are in a WSL2 terminal, you can install LLMStack using the above command.

Start LLMStack using the following command:

```sh
llmstack
```

Above commands will install and start LLMStack. It will create `.llmstack` in your home directory and places the database and config files in it when run for the first time. Once LLMStack is up and running, it should automatically open your browser and point it to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> You can add your own keys to providers like OpenAI, Cohere, Stability etc., from Settings page. If you want to provide default keys for all the users of your LLMStack instance, you can add them to the `~/.llmstack/config` file.

### Development Setup

For local development with Docker Compose:

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm (for client development)
- Python 3.11+ (for backend development)

#### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thinksaga/LLMStack.git
cd LLMStack
```

2. Start the development environment:
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file docker/.env.dev up -d

# Or use the Makefile shortcuts
make api-image  # Build API image
make app-image  # Build app image
```

3. Access the application:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:9000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3000/admin
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:25432
- **Redis**: localhost:26379
- **Weaviate**: localhost:28080

#### Default Credentials
- **Admin Username**: `admin`
- **Admin Password**: `promptly`

#### User Registration
Self-service user registration is disabled. New users must be created by administrators through the Django admin panel at `/admin`.

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - The API container uses `pg_isready` to check database connectivity
   - If you see "role 'appuser' does not exist", the database user check failed
   - Solution: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the entrypoint script is using the correct database user

2. **Nginx Configuration Errors**
   - If the app container fails with "host not found in upstream", check nginx.conf
   - The runner service is commented out in development, so remove runner references from nginx config

3. **Migration Errors**
   - Database migrations may fail with model lookup errors
   - Ensure migrations use `apps.get_model()` for historical model references
   - For fresh databases, migrations should handle missing data gracefully

4. **Package Compatibility**
   - Debian Trixie uses different package names (e.g., `libpcre2-8-0` instead of `libpcre3`)
   - Poetry 1.8.3+ uses `--without` instead of `--no-dev`

5. **Container Build Issues**
   - Clear Docker cache: `docker system prune -a --volumes -f`
   - Rebuild images: `make api-image && make app-image`

**Services Status Check:**
```bash
# Check all containers
docker ps

# Check logs for specific service
docker logs llmstack-dev-api-1
docker logs llmstack-dev-app-1
```

**Database Management:**
```bash
# Access PostgreSQL
docker exec -it llmstack-dev-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d postgres

# Reset database (removes all data)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml down
docker volume rm llmstack-dev_postgresdata
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Features

**🤖 Agents**: Build generative AI agents like AI SDRs, Research Analysts, RPA Automations etc., **without writing any code**. Connect agents to your internal or external tools, search the web or browse the internet with agents.

**🔗 Chain multiple models**: LLMStack allows you to chain multiple LLMs together to build complex generative AI applications.

**📊 Use generative AI on your Data**: Import your data into your accounts and use it in AI chains. LLMStack allows importing various types (_CSV, TXT, PDF, DOCX, PPTX etc.,_) of data from a variety of sources (_gdrive, notion, websites, direct uploads etc.,_). Platform will take care of preprocessing and vectorization of your data and store it in the vector database that is provided out of the box.

**🛠️ No-code builder**: LLMStack comes with a no-code builder that allows you to build AI chains without any coding experience. You can chain multiple LLMs together and connect them to your data and business processes.

**☁️ Deploy to the cloud or on-premise**: LLMStack can be deployed to the cloud or on-premise. You can deploy it to your own infrastructure or use our cloud offering at [Promptly](https://trypromptly.com).

**🚀 API access**: Apps or chatbots built with LLMStack can be accessed via HTTP API. You can also trigger your AI chains from **_Slack_** or **_Discord_**.

**🏢 Multi-tenant**: LLMStack is multi-tenant. You can create multiple organizations and add users to them. Users can only access the data and AI chains that belong to their organization.
